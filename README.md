# BERT and GPT2 for Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing and has a wide range of applications in fields such as marketing, customer service, and opinion mining. With the advancements in deep learning techniques, sentiment analysis has become more sophisticated and accurate. One of the recent breakthroughs in the field is the fusion of two powerful language models: **BERT** and **GPT-2**.  
BERT, which stands for "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers," is a pre-trained language model developed by **Google**. It has been trained on a massive corpus of text and has shown remarkable performance on a variety of NLP tasks. On the other hand, GPT-2, which stands for "Generative Pretrained Transformer 2," is another pre-trained language model developed by **OpenAI**. It has been trained on a massive amount of text and can generate human-like text, making it suitable for various NLP tasks.
